# Uncovering-Key-Network-Characteristics-of-Social-Network-Pages-An-ERGM-Analysis-

This project examines the network structure of a social media platform Facebook with four different types of pages: Politicians, TV shows, Government organizations, and Companies. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) are used to analyze the network structure and identify significant network statistics that explain the patterns of connections between the pages. The network is constructed from available data on the nodes and edges in the network, and various structural properties of the network are considered, including degree distributions and edge density. Goodness-of-fit tests are performed to evaluate the adequacy of the ERGM models in capturing the observed network structure. The analysis aims to gain insights into the structure of social media networks with multiple types of pages and identify the key network characteristics that shape the patterns of connections between them. The use of ERGMs provides a comprehensive understanding of the network structure and potential opportunities for research and analysis.
